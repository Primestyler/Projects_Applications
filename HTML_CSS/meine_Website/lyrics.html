Angel, don't fly so close to me
I pull you down eventually
You don't want to lose those wings
People like me break beautiful things
Angel, don't fly so close to me
I'm what you want, not what you need
You don't want to lose those wings
People like me break beautiful things

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
I give it all up to ease your pain, yeah, I would do that all day
I stepped back from the game to keep you out of harm's way
Risk it all for the game but it take more than one person
Two people one 'til I feel the same when you hurtin'
I was still in middle school when Givens fled the whip
Bodies were droppin' before we ever knew 'bout the truck
We gonna be family no matter what way this go, brother
From the ugly corner where everybody betray each other
I let you hang in the jets, I let you bang with my set
Put you before my own flesh like why’d I ever do that?
Me and the streets got soul ties
The devil on my shoulder he whisper but I told him

[Chorus: Muni Long, Jimin & Muni Long]
Angel, don't fly so close to me
I pull you down eventually
You don't want to lose those wings
People like me break beautiful things
Angel, don't fly so close to me
I'm what you want, not what you need
You don't want to lose those wings
People like me break beautiful things
