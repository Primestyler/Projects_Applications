# BDINF_Semester_Project

The main notebook which explains and documents the final project work is "final_project.ipynb".

The JSON files used by the notebook are saved in this repository as well.

Additionally a second notebook contains an analysis of some aspects of the austrian bundesliga ("api-football_com_autrian_bundesliga.ipynb").
